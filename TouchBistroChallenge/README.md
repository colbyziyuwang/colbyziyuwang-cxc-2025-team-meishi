# **Byte & Bistro: Data-Driven Dining Insights**

## **Inspiration**
Restaurants operate in a fast-paced, highly competitive environment where efficiency and customer experience directly impact success. We wanted to leverage **real-world restaurant data** to uncover trends in **sales efficiency, tipping behavior, and order durations** to provide **actionable insights** for restaurant owners. Our goal was to **help businesses optimize revenue, staffing, and customer satisfaction** using a **data-driven approach**.

## **What It Does**
Our project **analyzes restaurant performance metrics** across different venue types (e.g., fast food, fine dining, bars) by benchmarking:
- **Sales per minute** ‚Äì Which venues generate revenue the fastest?
- **Tip percentage trends** ‚Äì Where do customers tip the most (or least)?
- **Order durations** ‚Äì How long do customers typically stay in different venue types?
Using these insights, we provide **data-backed recommendations** to help restaurants **improve service quality, optimize staffing, and maximize profitability**.

## **How We Built It**
- **Data Processing:** We cleaned and merged **TouchBistro‚Äôs venue and billing datasets**, handling missing values and outliers with **IQR filtering**.
- **KPI Calculation:** We computed **median sales per minute, tipping percentage, and order durations** to provide accurate benchmarks.
- **Visualizations:** Using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**, we created **bar charts** and comparative analyses to highlight performance differences across venue types.
- **Actionable Insights:** Based on the analysis, we provided **business recommendations** on pricing, staffing, and tipping strategies.

## **Challenges We Ran Into**
- **Dealing with Outliers:** Some venues had **extreme order durations (several days!)** or unusually high/low sales. We refined our filtering methods to ensure accurate insights.
- **Tipping Data Issues:** Many venues had **zero or missing tip data**, making it challenging to analyze tipping trends across all categories.
- **Interpreting Venue-Specific Trends:** Certain venue types (e.g., **buffets, entertainment complexes**) showed unexpected behaviors, requiring deeper investigation.

## **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**
- Successfully cleaned and processed a **large, real-world dataset** to derive meaningful insights.
- Developed **clear, actionable business recommendations** that can help **restaurants optimize operations**.
- Created **intuitive visualizations** that make data insights easy to understand.
- Provided a **unique perspective on tipping behavior**, challenging conventional assumptions about how customers tip in different restaurant settings.

## **What We Learned**
- **Data storytelling is key** ‚Äì Raw numbers don‚Äôt mean much until they are translated into meaningful insights.
- **Benchmarking performance across different restaurant types** provides valuable operational insights for businesses.
- **Median values are often better than mean** for analyzing **highly skewed restaurant transaction data**.
- **Tipping behavior varies widely** and can be influenced by how payment systems prompt customers.

## **What's Next for Byte & Bistro: Data-Driven Dining Insights**
- **Expanding the dataset** ‚Äì Incorporating **external factors like weather, holidays, and inflation** to see their impact on restaurant sales and tipping.
- **Predictive modeling** ‚Äì Building a machine learning model to forecast **future sales trends** and **optimal staffing schedules**.
- **Interactive dashboard** ‚Äì Developing a **web-based visualization tool** where restaurant owners can explore insights specific to their venue.
- **Exploring alternative revenue strategies** ‚Äì Investigating how **dynamic pricing, subscription models, or loyalty programs** could improve restaurant profitability.
